On each hypervisor, there should be a default network bridge name virbro0. All hypervisors will be added to this network interface and automatically assigned an IP address. By default, the hypervisor uses the address range of 192.168.122.2 - 192.168.122.254 to assign to the vertual machines. Using NAT, the host can route packets from the virtual machines using private address to external network interfaces. 

Do the following on each hypervisor to check the bridge for each: 

		# brctl show virbr0

		# ip addr show virbr0

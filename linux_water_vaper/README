Hey this focus on VMs because that was the hot spot when this book was written. Albeit, containers(dockers, podman, cgroups) are the best way to go from trends. Albeit, containers as a technology is being pushed by being able to host VMs in container which will be the next step for orgainzations from the stand point of security, overall saving money and better performance with such a sandbox. Using technology such as kubernetes engine to control your infostructure with yaml files to control your companies playbook to intergrate better with a conglomerate intergration. Thats a lot of infomation but I would like to add #K8Crazy.

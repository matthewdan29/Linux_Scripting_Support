Lon in to each hypervisor and follow the steps 

		a) Check the NFS share availablity. 

		b) Mount the NFS share. Add infomation about the share to the "/etc/fstab" file. For our example, to allow the directory form the 192.168.0.1 system to be mounted on the same directory locally each time the system boots, the entry in the "/etc/fstab" file could look like this: 
			(storage.example.com:/storage /var/libvirt/images nfs defaults 0 0)
	
		c) Test the NFS mont. To check that you got the mount entry correct, run 
			# mount -a 
			# mount | grep libvirt 

with your hypervisors and storage now in place, you can now begin creating your virtual machines.

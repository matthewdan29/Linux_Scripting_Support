The steps needed for encryption/decryption of files using asymmetric keys (linux using gpg2 and tar with a pair key DB)(This is file handling basics)

	1) Generate the key pair and the key ring. 
	2) Export a copy of your public key to a file. 
	3) Share the public key file. 
	4) Individuals who want to send you encrypted files add your public key to their key ring. 
	5) A file is encrypted using your public key. 
	6) The encrypted file is sent to you. 
	7) You decrypt the file using your private key. 

Remember that in asymmetric cryptiography, each public and private key is a paired set that works together.

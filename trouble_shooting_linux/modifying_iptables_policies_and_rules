Here are a few options for modifying the firewall: 

	-t tables
		The "iptables" command listed along with this switch is applied to the "table". By default, the "filter" table is used: 
		$ iptables -t filter -P OUTPUT DROP 

	-P chain target 
		Sets the overall policy for a particular "chain". The rules in the "chain" are checked for matches. If no match occurs, then the "chain's" listed "target" is used
		$ iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT

	-A chain
		Set a rule, called an "appended rule", which is an exception to the overall policy for the "chain" designated. 
		$ iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.140.67.25 -j REJECT

	-I rule# chain
		Inserts an appended rule into a specific location, designated by the rule#, in the appended rule list for the "chain" designated
		$ iptables -I 5 INPUT -s 10.140.67.23 -j DROP 

	-D chain rule#
		Deletes a particular rule, designated by the rule#, from the "chain", for the "chain"designated.
		$ iptables -D INPUT 5

	-j target 
		If the criteria in the rule are met, the firewall should jump to this designated "target" for processing. 
		$ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.140.67.25 -j DROP 

	-d IP address 
		Assigns the rule listed to apply to the designated destination IP address. 
		$ iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.140.67.25 -j REJECT 

	-s IP address
		Assigns the rule listed to apply to the designated source IP address. 
		$ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.140.67.24 -j ACCEPT
		
	-p protocol 
		Assigns the rule listed to apply to the protocol designated. 
		$ IPTABLES -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP 

	--dport port#
		Assigns the rule listed to apply to certain protocol packets coming into the designated port#. 
		$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP 

	--sport port#
		Assigns the rule listed to apply to certain protocol packets going out of the designated port#. 
		$ iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -j ACCEPT

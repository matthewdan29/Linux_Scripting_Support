Generating an SSL key and self-signed certificate

	To begin setting up SSL, use the "openssl" command, which is part of the "openssl" package, to generate your public and private key. After that, you can generate your own self-signed  certificate to test the site or to use internally. 

1) If the "openssl" package is not already installed, install it as follows: 
		apt install opessl 
			or 
		yum install openssl 
			or 
		flatpack install openssl (IDK if flatpack has this in its repo)

2) generate a 1024-bit RSA private key and save it to a file: 
		# cd /etc/pki/tls/private
		# openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024
		# chmod 600 server.key 

			(Make sure you specify the correct <filename> in the Apache configuration later.)

		/* In higher-security environment, encrypting the key by adding the -des3 argument after the "genrsa" argument on the "openssl" command line is a good idea (say you work for a goverment or orginization that hold CC#'s ). When prompted for a passphrase, press Enter:*/

		# openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024

3) If you don't plan to have your certiicate signed, or if you want to test your configuration, generate a self-signed certifficate and save it in a file name "server.crt" in the "/etc/pki/tls/certs" dir: 
		
		# cd /etc/pki/tls/certs
		# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -shal -days 365 \ -key /etc/pki/tls/private/server.key \ -out server.crt 

4) Edit the "/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf" file to change the key and certificate locations to use the ones you just created. For example: 

		SSLCertificateFile	/etc/pki/tls/cert/server.crt
		SSLCertificateKeyFile	/etc/pki/tls/private/server.key

5) Restart or relaod the httpd server. 

6) Open "https://localhost" from a local browser again, repeat the procedure to review, and accept the new certificate.
